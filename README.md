# Arduino-series-led-lights
8 led lights will turn on and off in series and different variations.  
the sketch_jan10a.ino is the code file that you need to upload and run in your Arduino.
The Frantic Jarv.brd is file in which I've made the circuit. You can copy that or build a circuit of your own.
Build the circuit, upload the code and enjoy :)
